  <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I’m a <strong className="text-indigo-600 dark:text-indigo-400">Senior WordPress & WooCommerce Full Stack Developer</strong> with <strong>12+ years</strong> of experience in delivering scalable, secure, and high-performance web solutions.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I have <strong>8 years of hands-on experience with Core PHP</strong>, <strong>7 years with OpenCart</strong>, and <strong>2 years with Magento 2</strong>, making me confident across multiple eCommerce platforms. I’ve also handled custom integrations, shipping automation, and multi-vendor systems.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    On the frontend, I bring <strong>8+ years of experience</strong> with <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>1+ year of React.js</strong>. I’m also confident with REST APIs, performance tuning, and secure coding practices.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I enjoy the process of debugging and solving tricky issues — its like solving a puzzle that sharpens my skills every time. With full-stack experience, I understand how frontend and backend work together, helping me build seamless, efficient, and bug-free applications.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    I’ve independently handled several projects <strong>from scratch</strong> — including <strong>client discussions</strong>, <strong>project documentation</strong>, <strong>frontend/backend coding</strong>, and <strong>deployment</strong>. This end-to-end ownership makes me highly self-reliant and result-driven.
  </p>

  <p className="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
    Over the years, I’ve delivered solutions to <strong>200+ global clients</strong>, adapting to legacy systems, custom business models, and tight delivery schedules. Apart from WordPress & WooCommerce, I’ve also worked with <strong>Laravel, YII, Shopify, PrestaShop, Magento, and OpenCart</strong>. My ability to learn fast and solve real business problems has helped me build long-term client relationships.
